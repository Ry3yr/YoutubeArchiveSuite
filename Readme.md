# Youtube Archival Suite

Lil Suite which aims to help with archiving youtube videos to waybackarchive.

Backup can happen by 
•uploading mp4 (videoID /or/ correct title as name)
 or 
•supplying  a downloadlink (f.e. from notube) and a filename

If all fails a manualbackup.php exists to create the json for video.json manually.

After up/download to (your) server, wayback archival is auto triggered, with the timestamp url saved to json aswell
